However, focusing on these key aspects will generally lead to more efficient and injury-free running:\n\n* **Posture:** Stand tall, relaxed shoulders, slight forward lean from the ankles, not the waist.\n\n* **Foot strike:** Aim for a midfoot strike, avoiding heel striking (which can increase impact) and forefoot striking (which can strain calves). Let your foot land naturally beneath your center of mass.\n\n* **Cadence:**  Higher cadence (steps per minute) is generally better, aiming for around 170-180 steps per minute.  This reduces impact and improves"
